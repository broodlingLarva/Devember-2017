------------------------------------------
A while loop is a code which make something repeat over and over again.
An example that I found in the book:
name = ''
while name != 'your name':
  print('Please type your name.')
name = input()
print('Thank you!')
------------------------------------------
It will keep printing out "Please type your name"
until the user types their name.

range() function
------------------------------------------
A range function is basically a while loop, 
but instead of looping forever, it has a 
set amount of times that it can do.
An example of a range function:
for value in range(1,5):
print(value)
------------------------------------------
You can also make a list of numbers with the 
range function.

numbers = list(range(1,6))
print(numbers)

>>> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
