Putting Python 3 code onto IDLE for now
------------------------------------------
Data Types
------------------------------------------
There are 3 Data types.
Integer, Float, and string.

Integers- are numbers that do not have a decimal point.
Examples include: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 and also -1, -2, etc.

Floats- are numbers that have a decimal point.
Examples include: 1.24, 2.56, 16.4, 10.5

Strings- are anything that are betwwen 2 quotation marks.
Numbers in quotes count as strings
Examples include: "apple", "cat", "12", and "12.5"

|Vocabulary|
String concantenation- when you add two string together.
Examples include: "cat" + " dog" = "cat dog"

String replication- when you make more than one of the same string.
Examples include: "dog" * 5 = "dogdogdogdogdog"
------------------------------------------
Variables
------------------------------------------
Variables are letters that contain a value
apple = 12        is a variable
apple2 = "carrot"  is a variable

to use variables, you just type the variable name.
typing: apple will give you 12.
typing: apple2 will give you carrot.

| RULES| From Automate the Boring Stuff
1. It can be only one word.
2. It can use only letters, numbers, and the underscore (_) character.
3. It canâ€™t begin with a number
------------------------------------------
Mathematics
------------------------------------------
Addition is: +
Subtraction is: -
Multiplication is: *
Division is: /

Other Mathematic Symbols
exponent is: **
remainder is: %
integer devision is: //

The Python language is like a scientific calculator. It does math in order of operations(PEMDAS).
So 2+4*5 is 22.

This is it for now. 12/1/2017
Pg. 47 will be covered tomorrow.
