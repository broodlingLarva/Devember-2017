After finishing the quiz in the book, I am now going to learn about Booleans.
Booleans are basically True and false.
------------------------------------------
There is also comparison operators which compares two values and then moves it to 
a boolean value.
The following is a list of comparison operators
------------------------------------------
Operator Meaning
== Equal to
!= Not equal to
< Less than
> Greater than
<= Less than or equal to
>= Greater than or equal to
------------------------------------------
When you do something like: 5==5
the outcome will be True, because 5 is equal to 5.
I you put in 5==4, the outcome will be False, because
5 is not equal to 4.
------------------------------------------
You can also make the statement True, when the two Booleans are True.
>>> (1 == 2) or (2 == 2)
True
>>> (1 == 2) or (3 == 2)
False
>>> 
------------------------------------------
if name == 'Justin':
print('Justin.')
If the name is Justin, then it will print Justin.
------------------------------------------
I will make a separate section on if, else, and elif on another file.
