# Devember-2017

I, Justin Kim, will participate to the next Devember. My Devember will be learning Python. I promise I will program for my Devember for at least an hour, every day of the next December. I will also write a daily public devlog and will make the produced code publicly available on the internet. No matter what, I will keep my promise. I will learn to program in Python using Python Crash Course and Automate the Boring Stuff. I will also occasionally go onto Hour of Code for class.
